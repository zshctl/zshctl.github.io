                           Welcome to `zshctl`.

The `zshctl` OS X installer will install `zshctl` on OS X using Homebrew.

Homebrew is necessary for automatic, yet prompted and confirmed, installation of
the programs that `zshctl` needs to run. `zshctl` will use Homebrew install
the programs it needs as needed. If you never use a particular `zshctl`
command, then you will not install its dependencies.

If Homebrew is not installed, the `zshctl` OS X installer will run the Homebrew
installer.

You can run the `zshctl` OS X installer yourself with the following command.

  zsh -c "$(curl -L https://zshctl.sh/install/Darwin-brew.zsh)"

We can run the installer for you, but first we're going to dump the contents of
the installer to your console for you to review.
