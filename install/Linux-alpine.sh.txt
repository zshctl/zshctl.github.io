                           Welcome to `zshctl`.

The `zshctl` Alpine installer will install `zshctl` on Alpine Linux using the
system package installer `apk`. It must run as `root`. You can run this
installer directly yourself with the following command.

  sudo sh -c "$(curl -sL https://zshctl.sh/install/Linux-alpine.sh)"

We can run the installer for you, but first we're going to dump the contents of
the installer to your console for you to review.
