                           Welcome to `zshctl`.

Unfortunately, we cannot determine your hardware platform and operating system
distribution so we're not going to be able to give you a proper installation at
this time.

You can clone https://github.com/flatheadmill/zshctl to your system, set the
execute bit and put it in your path.

We'll work on supporting you mavericks, but not today.
