                           Welcome to `zshctl`.

The `zshctl` Ubuntu installer will install `zshctl` on Ubuntu Linux using the
system package installer APT. It must run as `root`. You can run this installer
directly yourself with the following command.

  sudo bash -c "$(wget -qO - https://zshctl.sh/install/Linux-ubuntu.bash)"

We can run the installer for you, but first we're going to dump the contents of
the installer to your console for you to review.
