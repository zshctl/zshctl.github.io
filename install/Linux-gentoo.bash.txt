                           Welcome to `zshctl`.

The `zshctl` Gentoo installer will install `zshctl` on Gentoo Linux using the
system package installer `emerge`. It must run as `root`. You can run this
installer directly yourself with the following command.

  sudo bash -c "$(wget -qO - https://zshctl.sh/install/Linux-gentoo.bash)"

We can run the installer for you, but first we're going to dump the contents of
the installer to your console for you to review.
